# Relational Database Labs
This repository contains a series of SQL labs designed to enhance understanding of relational databases. Each lab builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and techniques for working with SQL and database management systems. 
The labs progress from basic table creation to more advanced topics like `indexing`, `object-relational features`, and `collections`.

# Objectives
- Develop a solid foundation in relational database design and SQL queries.
- Explore constraints, relationships, and normalization techniques.
- Learn about advanced SQL features such as indexing, collections, and object types.
- Practice real-world database scenarios through hands-on tasks.

# Lab Summaries
## Lab 1: Basics of SQL and Table Creation
Introduction to creating `relational tables`, `applying constraints`, and `executing basic SQL queries`.

## Lab 2: Object types and Inheritence
Focused on defining Object types using the concepts of Relational Object Database, and exploring the hierarchy between types in a database.

## Lab 3: Referenced Objects
Covered the concept of references in a relational object database, which replaces the concept of foreign key in traditional relational databases, and exploring how is this a better solution to represent relationships between different entities.

## Lab 4: Object Types and Collections
Introduced the concept of `collections` and nested tables, to store multiple entities that belong to one record in a table.

## Lab 5: Referential Collections
Explored the use of collections of referenecs and nested tables in SQL.

## Lab 6: Indexing and Performance
Delved deeper into `indexing`, including composite and functional indexes, and examined their effect on query performance.
